    <p class="employeesText">Hanne opened the salon in her hometown Aalborg after completing the 4-year hairdresser education at the Hairdresser School in Randers and the follow-up practical experience at Frisør Toftild in Aalborg. Hanne has dreamt since her teenage years about being a hairdresser and opening her own salon.<br><br>“What fascinates me about the profession is how the most beautiful features in the face can be highlighted by simply making, changing, or coloring a few lines. Every single face and hair is unique, and that is why it is so important to find the exact style and look that serves you the best. The best part about my job is that every day I get the opportunity to make people happier. I love it when I can see that I have contributed to make somebody feel beautiful, and when I can experience how their self-confidence increases along with renewed energy and happiness. Moreover, my job allows me to meet new, interesting, and wonderful people every day.”</p>
